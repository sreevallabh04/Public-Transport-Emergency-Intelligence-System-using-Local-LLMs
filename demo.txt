Smart Bus Accident & Passenger Health Monitoring System
An IoT-Based Human-Aware Emergency Response Framework with Edge Intelligence
1. Abstract

In modern public transportation systems, emergency response to bus accidents is largely dependent on vehicle-level indicators such as impact severity and location, with little to no awareness of the physiological condition of passengers. This lack of passenger-specific insight leads to delayed, generalized, and often inefficient medical intervention. This project presents a Smart Bus Accident & Passenger Health Monitoring System that integrates IoT-based accident detection, wearable health monitoring, edge intelligence, and cloud-based data services to enable real-time, passenger-wise health assessment during bus accidents.

The system combines a bus-mounted IoT unit for detecting collisions and hazardous events with smartwatch-based continuous monitoring of passenger vitals including heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and motion patterns. A local edge intelligence module running on a gateway device interprets these signals in real time and classifies passenger conditions as Normal, Panic, or Critical. Structured health summaries are transmitted to a backend and cloud infrastructure, enabling emergency services to receive actionable intelligence for prioritized medical response. The proposed framework demonstrates a scalable, privacy-aware, and human-centric approach to smart transportation safety.

2. Introduction

Public buses are a critical component of urban mobility, transporting large populations daily. Despite improvements in vehicle safety and traffic monitoring, bus accidents continue to pose significant risks due to the absence of passenger-specific health information during emergencies. Existing systems focus primarily on detecting accidents at the vehicle level and notifying authorities, without assessing how passengers are physically affected.

During a bus accident, emergency responders face critical uncertainties regarding the number of injured passengers, severity of injuries, and prioritization of medical care. Without real-time passenger health data, response efforts remain reactive and non-optimal. This project addresses this gap by introducing a human-aware emergency response system that couples accident detection with continuous passenger health monitoring and intelligent data interpretation.

3. Problem Statement

Current bus safety and emergency response systems suffer from the following limitations:

Accident detection is limited to vehicle-level events

No real-time assessment of individual passenger health

Emergency responders lack actionable severity information

Medical resources are deployed without prioritization

Systems rely heavily on manual reporting and delayed observation

These limitations result in delayed intervention, inefficient resource allocation, and increased risk to passenger safety.

4. Proposed Solution

The proposed system introduces a Smart Bus Accident & Passenger Health Monitoring System that integrates IoT, wearable technology, edge intelligence, and cloud services to provide real-time insight into passenger conditions during accidents.

Key objectives include:

Detecting bus accidents reliably using IoT sensors

Monitoring passenger health continuously using wearables

Interpreting health data in context using edge intelligence

Transmitting structured passenger severity data to cloud services

Enabling faster and prioritized emergency response

5. System Architecture Overview

The system follows a four-layer architecture:

Bus Accident Detection Layer

Passenger Health Monitoring Layer

Local Intelligence & Gateway Layer

Backend, Cloud & Emergency Response Layer

Each layer operates independently while contributing to a unified emergency response pipeline.

6. System Components
6.1 Bus Accident Detection Unit

Installed within the bus, this unit continuously monitors vehicle dynamics and safety conditions.

SOS push button

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module

Vehicle-powered DC supply

6.2 Passenger Health Monitoring Unit

Each passenger is associated with a seat inside the bus and monitored using a smartwatch.

Wearable Sensors:

Heart rate sensor

Heart rate variability (HRV)

Motion sensors

These signals provide indicators of stress, panic, shock, abnormal physiological response, or loss of movement.

Gateway Device:

Passenger smartphone

Acts as a computation and communication gateway

7. Local Intelligence & Gateway Layer

This layer hosts edge intelligence responsible for real-time reasoning and decision support.

Role of Edge Intelligence

Correlates accident events with passenger health data

Interprets sensor patterns in real-world context

Classifies passenger condition into:

Normal

Panic

Critical

Generates structured summaries describing observed conditions

This processing is performed locally to ensure low latency, high reliability, and privacy preservation.

8. Backend & Cloud Infrastructure

The backend and cloud layers provide centralized data management, visualization, and emergency coordination.

Backend Services

RESTful APIs for receiving accident and passenger health summaries

Data validation and aggregation

Interface between gateway devices and cloud storage

Cloud Services

Persistent storage of accident events and passenger severity data

Historical analysis and visualization support

Integration with emergency response systems

Only structured and relevant data is transmitted, avoiding continuous raw sensor streaming.

9. Mobile Application

The mobile application serves as both a passenger interface and a gateway control interface.

Seat-Based Identification

At application startup, the passenger’s seat number is clearly displayed (e.g., Seat B12), as seat location is used to identify and track passengers during emergencies.

Core Screens

Passenger Setup / Seat Information Screen

Dashboard Screen (bus status and health summary)

Passenger Health Details Screen

Emergency Alert Screen

The application presents health status, accident alerts, and emergency notifications in a clear and accessible manner.

10. System Operation Flow

Continuous monitoring of passenger health and bus motion

Accident detected by bus-mounted IoT unit

Edge intelligence processes passenger health data

Passenger conditions classified in real time

Structured summaries sent to backend and cloud
